How to build this project:

1. Create files to make sure they will not break build:

$touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog

2. Run "aclocal", "autoconf", "autoheader" and "automake" in the right order to create config.h.in, Makefile.in, configure and a numer of axiliary files:

$autoreconf --force --install

3. Creates Makefile from Makefile.in and config.h from config.h.in

$./configure

4. Finally build your project using make command

$make
